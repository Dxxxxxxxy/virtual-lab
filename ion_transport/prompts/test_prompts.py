"""Test prompts for ion transport symposium - simplified version."""

# Simple test agenda
TEST_AGENDA = """
Explore the fundamental similarities and differences in ion transport between electrochemical systems and membrane systems.

Each expert should:
1. Briefly describe how ions move in your system (key mechanisms)
2. Identify the most important equation or principle that governs ion transport in your field
3. Discuss one specific example where understanding ion transport is critical

The goal is to identify common theoretical principles that apply to both fields.
"""

# Simple questions to answer
TEST_QUESTIONS = (
    "What is the primary driving force for ion transport in your system?",
    "What physical or chemical property determines ion selectivity in your system?",
    "Can you identify one equation or principle that might apply to both fields?",
)

# Optional: Rules for the discussion
TEST_RULES = (
    "Keep explanations concise and accessible to non-experts",
    "Focus on fundamental principles rather than technical details",
    "Actively look for connections to the other expert's field",
)
