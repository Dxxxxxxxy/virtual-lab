        "message": "This is the beginning of a team meeting to discuss your research project. This is a meeting with the team lead, Symposium Chair and PI, and the following team members: Electrochemistry Scientist, Membrane Science Expert, Biological Ion Transport Scientist, Iontronics Scientist, Scientific Critic.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\n\nROUND 1: Map the Landscape of Ion Transport Theory\n\nObjective: Create a comprehensive, critical survey of how each field approaches ion transport.\n\nEach expert will present (10-15 minutes worth of content):\n\nA. FUNDAMENTAL EQUATIONS (be explicit about assumptions)\n   - What is your field's \"master equation\" for ion flux?\n   - State it mathematically if possible (or describe in words)\n   - List the key assumptions (steady-state? dilute? electroneutral? linear response?)\n   - When do these assumptions break down in practice?\n\nB. PHYSICAL MECHANISMS (diffusion, migration, convection, etc.)\n   - Which transport mechanism typically dominates in your systems?\n   - How do you experimentally distinguish between mechanisms?\n   - What dimensionless numbers govern the competition between mechanisms?\n\nC. SELECTIVITY (how your system chooses between ions)\n   - What property determines selectivity: charge, size, hydration, binding?\n   - Where does selectivity occur: at entry, during transit, or at exit?\n   - Provide a quantitative example: \"Ion A vs Ion B: selectivity = X because...\"\n\nD. LIMITING PHENOMENA (what sets maximum transport rate)\n   - What causes \"saturation\" or \"limiting current\" in your systems?\n   - Is the bottleneck in bulk transport, interface kinetics, or a boundary layer?\n   - Give a real example with numbers (current density, flux, concentration, etc.)\n\nE. ONE CRITICAL CHALLENGE in your field that relates to ion transport\n\nAfter each expert finishes, the Scientific Critic will provide feedback before moving to the next expert.\n\nAFTER ALL EXPERTS HAVE SPOKEN:\nThe Symposium Chair will synthesize and identify:\n- Which equations appear in multiple fields (possibly under different names)\n- Which mechanisms are universal vs. field-specific\n- Where terminology differs but physics is the same\n- Outstanding questions that need clarification in Round 2\n\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. What is the governing equation for ion flux in your field? State assumptions.\n\n2. What physical property determines ion selectivity in your system, and how is it measured?\n\n3. What causes the 'limiting' or saturation behavior in ion transport for your systems?\n\nHere are the agenda rules that must be followed:\n\n1. Clearly state assumptions before presenting equations or models\n\n2. Provide quantitative estimates whenever possible (numbers, not just trends)\n\n3. Distinguish between established facts, likely hypotheses, and speculation\n\n4. Define technical jargon when first used or translate to common language\n\n5. Acknowledge the limits of your expertise and defer to other experts appropriately\n\n6. Support claims with specific examples, data, or literature references\n\n7. When making analogies, explicitly state where they hold and where they break down\n\nSymposium Chair and PI will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Symposium Chair and PI will synthesize the points raised by each team member, make decisions regarding the agenda based on team member input, and ask follow-up questions to gather more information and feedback about how to better address the agenda. This will continue for 2 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Symposium Chair and PI will summarize the meeting in detail for future discussions, provide a specific recommendation regarding the agenda, and answer the agenda questions (if any) based on the discussion while strictly adhering to the agenda rules (if any)."

        "message": "We\u2019ll run Round 1 as a structured \u201ctranslation exercise\u201d: each field states (i) its master flux law, (ii) what sets selectivity, (iii) what sets the ceiling (limiting/saturation), all with assumptions up front and at least one back-of-the-envelope number. My job as Chair is to force alignment on *variables* (what is the flux, what is the driving force, what is the control volume) and on *regimes* (dilute vs crowded, electroneutral vs space-charge, equilibrium vs driven).\n\n## 1) Proposed structure for Round 1 (to keep us comparable)\nFor each speaker, please anchor your talk around the same \u201cminimal template\u201d:\n\n1. **System definition (30\u201360 s):** geometry + length scale (nm channel, \u00b5m membrane, mm cell), electrolyte strength (mM vs 1 M), typical fields/gradients, and what is measured (current, tracer flux, permeability).\n2. **Master equation (3\u20135 min):** write the flux law and *explicitly list assumptions* (dilute solution, local equilibrium, constant diffusivity, electroneutrality, steady state, linear response, negligible convection, etc.).\n3. **Selectivity (3\u20134 min):** identify the *dominant free-energy discriminator* (electrostatic/Donnan, dehydration, specific binding, sterics, correlated ion effects) and where it acts (entry, in-pore, exit). Give one quantitative selectivity example.\n4. **Limiting/saturation (3\u20134 min):** identify the rate-limiting step (diffusion boundary layer, space-charge, surface conduction, pore occupancy, interfacial kinetics). Provide one number (limiting current density, flux, permeability, turnover rate).\n5. **One critical challenge (1\u20132 min):** what your field cannot yet predict reliably.\n\nThe Scientific Critic then gets 2\u20133 minutes to (i) flag hidden assumptions, (ii) demand a number, (iii) ask \u201cwhat breaks first?\u201d\n\n## 2) Unifying \u201ccommon language\u201d I want everyone to map onto\nAcross disciplines, most disagreements are about *which terms are kept* and *what is treated as an effective parameter*. Please try to express your model in terms of:\n\n- **Electrochemical potential**: \\(\\mu_i = \\mu_i^0 + RT\\ln a_i + z_i F\\phi + \\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}}\\)  \n  (activity \\(a_i\\), potential \\(\\phi\\), excess term \\(\\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}\\) for non-ideality/binding/crowding).\n- **Generic flux form** (Onsager/Nernst\u2013Planck family):  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{J}_i = -\\frac{D_i c_i}{RT}\\nabla \\mu_i \\;+\\; c_i\\mathbf{u}\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is convection (if relevant).  \n  Then each field can say what they assume for \\(D_i\\), \\(a_i\\), \\(\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}}\\), and whether \\(\\phi\\) comes from Poisson, electroneutrality, or is imposed.\n- **Continuity**: \\(\\partial_t c_i + \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i = R_i\\) (with reactions/binding \\(R_i\\) if needed).\n\nIf your field uses different notation (Goldman\u2013Hodgkin\u2013Katz, Kedem\u2013Katchalsky, Poisson\u2013Nernst\u2013Planck, Maxwell\u2013Stefan, hopping/Marcus, Landauer), please explicitly map it to \\(\\nabla \\mu_i\\) and identify what is \u201clumped\u201d into an effective permeability/conductance.\n\n## 3) Quantitative anchors (so we don\u2019t stay qualitative)\nI will repeatedly ask for at least one of the following per talk:\n\n- **Typical concentration** (e.g., 1 mM vs 1 M) and **Debye length** estimate (order-of-magnitude).\n- **Typical field** (V/m) or voltage drop (mV\u2013V) across a known length.\n- **Flux/current density**: e.g., \\(J\\) in mol m\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) or \\(i\\) in A m\\(^{-2}\\).\n- **Selectivity metric**: permeability ratio \\(P_K/P_{Na}\\), transference number \\(t_+\\), rejection \\(R\\), or binding free-energy difference \\(\\Delta\\Delta G\\) (kJ/mol).\n- **Dimensionless numbers** relevant to your regime: P\u00e9clet (convection vs diffusion), Dukhin (surface vs bulk conduction), Damk\u00f6hler (reaction vs transport), coupling coefficients, etc.\n\n## 4) \u201cFailure mode\u201d questions I will use to probe assumptions\nThese are the questions I want each expert to be ready for:\n\n1. **What breaks first if concentration increases?** (activity effects, ion\u2013ion correlations, crowding, variable dielectric, finite size)\n2. **What breaks first if the channel/membrane is nanoscopic?** (continuum breakdown, slip, discrete charges, single-file transport)\n3. **What breaks first at high fields/large currents?** (space-charge, water splitting, electro-osmotic instabilities, heating)\n4. **Where is electroneutrality invalid in your system, and does it matter for the observable?**\n5. **Is selectivity equilibrium (partitioning) or kinetic (barrier/transition-state) controlled? How do you tell?**\n\n## 5) Specific guiding questions for each team member (Round 1)\n### Electrochemistry Scientist\n- When you say \u201climiting current,\u201d do you mean **diffusion-limited** (Nernst layer) or **migration/space-charge-limited**? What is the canonical scaling you use?\n- In your master equation, when do you keep Poisson vs assume electroneutrality?\n- Give one concrete number: e.g., limiting current density for a 1:1 electrolyte at 10 mM with a 100 \u00b5m diffusion layer.\n\n### Membrane Science Expert\n- Are you using **solution\u2013diffusion**, **Donnan\u2013steric pore model**, **Maxwell\u2013Stefan**, or **Kedem\u2013Katchalsky**? Map it to \\(\\nabla \\mu_i\\).\n- Where does selectivity \u201clive\u201d: partition coefficient at the interface vs hindered diffusion in pores?\n- Provide a rejection/selectivity number at a stated salinity and pressure/voltage.\n\n### Biological Ion Transport Scientist\n- Are you treating channels as **continuum electrodiffusion (PNP/GHK)** or **discrete-state kinetics** (occupancy, knock-on)?\n- What is your selectivity metric: permeability ratio, conductance ratio, or \\(\\Delta\\Delta G\\) from binding?\n- For saturation: is it **single-file occupancy**, **gating**, or **diffusion access resistance**? Provide a typical single-channel current (pA) and convert to ions/s.\n\n### Iontronics Scientist\n- Clarify whether transport is **ionic drift-diffusion in polymers**, **mixed ionic\u2013electronic conduction**, or **electrochemical doping fronts**.\n- What sets selectivity: fixed charge, segmental solvation, specific ion effects?\n- What is the limiting phenomenon: ion depletion, electrode polarization, finite capacitance, or mechanical/solvation constraints? Provide a device-scale current density and switching time.\n\n### Scientific Critic\n- For each talk, please identify: (i) the *most fragile assumption*, (ii) the *missing control experiment*, (iii) one *dimensionless number* that should have been reported but wasn\u2019t.\n\n## 6) Two decisions I want the team to help me make by end of Round 1\n1. **Common core model for Round 2:** Do we unify around (electrochemical potential + continuity) with different closures for \\(\\mu^{\\mathrm{ex}}\\), or do we need two parallel cores (continuum PNP-like vs discrete-state kinetics)?\n2. **Benchmark problem:** Choose one shared \u201ctoy system\u201d (e.g., charged nanopore connecting two reservoirs under voltage and salt gradient) that every field can model in their language and compare predictions (selectivity + limiting current).\n\n## 7) Final clarifying questions before we start speakers\n1. What *single experimental observable* should we treat as the common currency across fields: current\u2013voltage curve, salt flux, permeability, or selectivity ratio?\n2. Do we want Round 1 to emphasize **steady-state** only, or include **transients** (important for iontronics and gating)?\n3. Are we comfortable using **electrochemical potential** as the shared driving force, even if some communities typically phrase it differently?\n\nIf the team agrees, we\u2019ll proceed in the stated order: Electrochemistry \u2192 Membranes \u2192 Biology \u2192 Iontronics, with the Critic after each, and I\u2019ll keep a running \u201cdictionary\u201d mapping terms to the same physics."

        "message": "## Electrochemistry Scientist (Round 1): Ion transport in electrochemical energy storage\n\n### 1) Governing equation for ion flux (with assumptions)\n**Assumptions (state explicitly):**\n- **Continuum transport** (length scales \u2273 a few nm; mean-field).\n- **Isothermal**, no significant thermal gradients.\n- **Binary electrolyte** (often a good first model for Li-salt in solvent, though real electrolytes are multi-species).\n- **Electroneutral bulk** in most porous electrodes/separators: \\(\\sum_i z_i c_i \\approx 0\\) except in **double layers** (EDL) of thickness \\(\\lambda_D\\) (typically ~0.3 nm at 1 M; ~3 nm at 10 mM).\n- **No convection** in typical Li-ion cells (liquid is stagnant in separator), but **electro-osmotic flow** can matter in nanochannels or charged pores (more membrane-like).\n- **Concentrated-solution effects** are often important in batteries (activity coefficients, Stefan\u2013Maxwell coupling). I\u2019ll start dilute (Nernst\u2013Planck) then state the concentrated correction.\n\n**Master equation (dilute-solution Nernst\u2013Planck):**\n\\[\n\\mathbf{J}_i = -D_i \\nabla c_i \\;-\\; \\frac{z_i D_i F}{RT}\\,c_i \\nabla \\phi \\;+\\; c_i \\mathbf{u}\n\\]\nwith continuity:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial t} + \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{J}_i = R_i\n\\]\nand charge conservation (electroneutral bulk) gives current density:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{i} = F\\sum_i z_i \\mathbf{J}_i\n\\]\n\n**Where assumptions break down in practice (electrochemistry-specific):**\n- **Concentrated electrolytes (\u2265 0.5\u20131 M)**: Nernst\u2013Planck with ideal \\(c_i\\) fails; need **electrochemical potential** with activities and cross-coupled friction (Stefan\u2013Maxwell).\n- **High-rate operation**: strong concentration gradients \u2192 **concentration-dependent conductivity \\(\\kappa(c)\\)** and diffusivity \\(D(c)\\); possible **space-charge** near ion-selective interfaces (e.g., cation-selective separators, charged pores).\n- **Nanoporous carbons / ionic liquids**: crowding and correlations invalidate mean-field PNP; need modified PNP / density functional / lattice-gas.\n- **Near electrodes**: interfacial kinetics couples to transport; boundary conditions are **Butler\u2013Volmer** (or Marcus) rather than fixed concentration.\n\n**Concentrated-solution (battery-relevant) statement (Newman framework):**\nA common practical form is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{i}_e = -\\kappa \\nabla \\phi_e \\;+\\; \\frac{2RT\\kappa}{F}(1-t_+^0)\\nabla \\ln a_\\pm\n\\]\nand salt conservation:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\cdot\\left(D_\\text{eff}\\nabla c\\right) + \\frac{1-t_+^0}{F}\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{i}_e\n\\]\nHere \\(t_+^0\\) is the **cation transference number in the solvent frame** (key parameter in batteries), \\(a_\\pm\\) mean ionic activity, and \\(\\kappa\\) electrolyte conductivity. This is essentially \u201cNernst\u2013Planck rewritten\u201d with non-ideality and reference-frame choices made explicit.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Physical property determining ion selectivity (and how measured)\nIn mainstream Li-ion batteries, the electrolyte is usually not strongly selective among cations because there\u2019s typically only one cation (Li\\(^+\\)). Selectivity becomes central in:\n- **Single-ion conducting electrolytes / ionomers** (fixed anions \u2192 preferential Li\\(^+\\) transport),\n- **Charged separators / coatings** (Donnan exclusion),\n- **Interphases (SEI/CEI)** that act as selective membranes.\n\n**Dominant selectivity determinants (electrochemistry view):**\n1. **Transference number \\(t_+\\)** (how much of current is carried by Li\\(^+\\) vs anion). This is a *transport selectivity* metric.\n2. **Partitioning / solvation free energy** at an interphase (SEI) or polymer: effectively a **chemical potential barrier** \\(\\Delta \\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}}\\).\n3. **Fixed charge density** in a polymer/membrane \u2192 **Donnan potential** that excludes co-ions (membrane science overlap).\n\n**How we measure selectivity quantitatively:**\n- **Transport number / transference number**:\n  - **Bruce\u2013Vincent polarization** (symmetric Li|electrolyte|Li): gives an apparent \\(t_+\\) but can be biased by interfacial resistance changes.\n  - **Hittorf method** (concentration change near electrodes).\n  - **eNMR** (electrophoretic NMR) gives species drift velocities directly; arguably the cleanest for liquid electrolytes.\n- **Typical values (facts, not speculation):**\n  - Conventional carbonate electrolyte (e.g., 1 M LiPF\\(_6\\) EC/EMC): \\(t_+^0 \\sim 0.2\u20130.4\\) (order-of-magnitude; depends on solvent/salt).\n  - Single-ion conducting polymers can reach \\(t_+ \\to 1\\) in principle, but often at the cost of lower conductivity.\n\n**Concrete selectivity example (transport selectivity):**\nIf \\(t_+^0 = 0.3\\), then **70% of the ionic current is carried by anions** in the solvent frame. Under galvanostatic discharge, that directly amplifies concentration polarization because only \\((1-t_+^0)\\) of the current contributes to salt depletion/accumulation in the electrolyte conservation equation.\n\n---\n\n### 3) What causes limiting/saturation behavior (with numbers)\nElectrochemical systems show \u201climiting\u201d behavior from **(i) bulk transport limits**, **(ii) interfacial kinetics**, or **(iii) coupled transport\u2013reaction instabilities**.\n\n#### A. Classical diffusion-limited current (liquid electrolyte to an electrode)\nFor a planar diffusion layer of thickness \\(\\delta\\), the diffusion-limited current density for a reacting ion of concentration \\(c\\) is:\n\\[\ni_\\text{lim} \\approx z F \\frac{D c}{\\delta}\n\\]\n**Example (order-of-magnitude):**\n- \\(z=1\\), \\(D = 1\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\) (Li\\(^+\\) in carbonate is ~10\\(^{-10}\\)\u201310\\(^{-9}\\)),\n- \\(c = 1000\\,\\text{mol}/\\text{m}^3\\) (1 M),\n- \\(\\delta = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 1\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}\\)\n\nThen:\n\\[\ni_\\text{lim} \\sim 96485 \\times \\frac{10^{-10}\\times 10^3}{10^{-4}}\n\\approx 96\\,\\text{A}/\\text{m}^2 \\approx 9.6\\,\\text{mA}/\\text{cm}^2\n\\]\nThat\u2019s a very relevant scale: many Li-metal plating/stripping experiments operate around 1\u201310 mA/cm\\(^2\\), so diffusion limitation is not academic.\n\n**Where this breaks:** in porous electrodes, \\(\\delta\\) is not a simple boundary layer; it\u2019s an effective transport length through tortuous pores, and migration contributes.\n\n#### B. Concentration polarization / salt depletion (battery porous media)\nEven before reaching a strict diffusion limit, **salt depletion** near an electrode can drive the local conductivity \\(\\kappa(c)\\) down, increasing overpotential sharply (\u201csoft limiting\u201d). This is strongly controlled by \\(t_+^0\\): lower \\(t_+\\) \u2192 stronger gradients.\n\nA useful dimensionless group here is a **transport Damk\u00f6hler-like number** comparing reaction demand to transport supply; in porous electrodes it appears as:\n\\[\n\\text{Da}_\\text{ion} \\sim \\frac{i L}{F D c}\n\\]\nWhen \\(\\text{Da}_\\text{ion} \\gtrsim 1\\), expect strong concentration gradients and approaching limiting behavior.\n\n#### C. Interfacial kinetics limit (Butler\u2013Volmer)\nAt the electrode/electrolyte interface:\n\\[\ni = i_0\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_a F\\eta}{RT}\\right)-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_c F\\eta}{RT}\\right)\\right]\n\\]\nIf \\(i_0\\) is small (e.g., through resistive SEI), kinetics dominates and you can see \u201csaturation\u201d in practice because \\(\\eta\\) grows rapidly with current.\n\n#### D. Additional electrochemistry-specific \u201climits\u201d (established vs hypothesis)\n- **Established:** **Ohmic limitation** in low-conductivity electrolytes/solid electrolytes: \\(i \\approx \\kappa \\Delta\\phi/L\\).\n- **Likely in some regimes:** **Space-charge-limited conduction** near ion-selective interfaces (overlimiting currents, electroconvection) \u2014 more common in membranes/nanopores than in typical battery separators, but relevant for charged coatings and solid electrolytes with blocking boundaries.\n- **Speculation (system-dependent):** In highly concentrated electrolytes/ionic liquids, \u201climiting\u201d may reflect **structural relaxation/viscosity** and correlated motion rather than simple diffusion.\n\n---\n\n### 4) One critical challenge (ion transport\u2013related)\n**Predictive transference numbers and diffusivities in concentrated electrolytes and interphases.**  \nWe can measure \\(t_+\\), \\(D\\), \\(\\kappa\\), but predicting them from molecular structure (salt/solvent/polymer) remains unreliable, especially when:\n- ion pairing/aggregation is strong,\n- activity coefficients vary sharply with concentration,\n- the SEI behaves like a heterogeneous mixed conductor.\n\nThis is exactly where a unified framework with membrane science (fixed charge, Donnan partitioning), biology (single-file occupancy), and iontronics (mixed ionic/electronic transport) could help\u2014*but only if we are explicit about what is mean-field vs correlation-dominated.*\n\n---\n\n### 5) Polite disagreement / alignment with Chair\u2019s framing\nI agree with using **electrochemical potential gradients** as the unifying language. One nuance: in batteries, many \u201cselectivity\u201d discussions are really about **reference frames** (solvent frame vs center-of-mass) and **coupled fluxes** (Stefan\u2013Maxwell). Two communities can report different \\(t_+\\) for the same electrolyte if they don\u2019t specify the frame and method\u2014this is a recurring source of confusion we should surface early.\n\n---\n\n### Questions I want to ask the other experts (to connect frameworks)\n1. **Membranes:** When you report ion selectivity (e.g., rejection), can you also report an equivalent **transference number** or **permselectivity** under current (not just at equilibrium)?\n2. **Biology:** For channels, is \u201climiting current\u201d typically **access resistance** (diffusion to the pore mouth) or **in-pore occupancy**? Can you separate them experimentally?\n3. **Iontronics:** In mixed ionic\u2013electronic conductors, what is the cleanest analog of \\(t_+\\)? Is it an ionic fraction of total conductivity, and how do you measure it without electrode artifacts?"

Selectivity comes from **sterics (size)** + **Donnan (charge)** + sometimes dielectric exclusion.\n\n**Breakdown:** when pores are so small that continuum viscosity/dielectric assumptions fail; or when specific adsorption changes effective charge.\n\n#### (iii) RO: Solution\u2013diffusion (dense layer; ions as \u201csolutes\u201d)\n**Assumptions:**\n- No convective flow of salt through the dense selective layer (water convects; salt diffuses).\n- Salt transport is by diffusion in polymer free volume; electromigration often neglected for neutral RO modeling but becomes relevant for charged RO/NF and for describing streaming potentials.\n\nSalt flux:\n\\[\nJ_s = -P_s\\,(c_{m,f}-c_{m,p})\n\\]\nWater flux:\n\\[\nJ_w = A(\\Delta P - \\Delta \\pi)\n\\]\nThis is a phenomenological reduction of the electrochemical potential framework where \\(P_s\\) lumps partitioning and diffusivity.\n\n**Breakdown:** at high salinity/pressure where coupling, concentration-dependent \\(P_s\\), and charge effects matter; also when fouling layers add additional \u201cmembranes.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2) What determines ion selectivity, and how is it measured?\n\n### Selectivity mechanisms (established)\n1. **Charge-based (Donnan exclusion):** fixed membrane charge repels co-ions and enriches counter-ions.\n   - Dominant in IEMs and charged NF.\n   - Quantified by **permselectivity** or **transport number** in membrane.\n2. **Size/steric exclusion:** hydrated ion size relative to pore size (NF).\n3. **Hydration/solvation (dielectric exclusion):** energy penalty for moving an ion into a low-dielectric pore/polymer; important in sub-nm pores and dense polymers.\n4. **Specific binding/complexation:** e.g., monovalent-selective IEMs with crown ethers; more specialized but real.\n\n### Where selectivity occurs\n- **At entry (partitioning):** Donnan + steric partitioning at solution/membrane interface.\n- **During transit:** different mobilities/hindrance; in IEMs, counter-ion mobility differences matter.\n- **At exit:** usually symmetric to entry unless asymmetric chemistry or concentration polarization.\n\n### How we measure selectivity (quantitative metrics)\n- **Rejection (RO/NF):**\n  \\[\n  R_i = 1-\\frac{c_{p,i}}{c_{f,i}}\n  \\]\n- **Permselectivity (IEM):** compare measured membrane potential to ideal Nernst potential for a concentration cell:\n  \\[\n  \\alpha = \\frac{\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{meas}}}{\\Delta \\phi_{\\text{ideal}}}\n  \\]\n  For a 1:1 electrolyte,\n  \\[\n  \\Delta \\phi_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{a_2}{a_1}\\right)\n  \\]\n- **Counter-ion transport number in membrane** \\(t_+^m\\) (direct analog to electrochemistry \\(t_+\\)): obtained from membrane potential + conductivity + co-ion leakage models, or from tracer experiments.\n\n### Quantitative selectivity example (IEM; Donnan-driven co-ion exclusion)\nTake a **cation-exchange membrane** with fixed charge \\(X = 1\\) M (in membrane water) in contact with **0.1 M NaCl**.\n\nUsing electroneutrality in membrane: \\(c_{\\mathrm{Na}}^m - c_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^m = X\\).  \nAssuming ideal Donnan partitioning for a symmetric 1:1 salt gives:\n\\[\nc_{\\mathrm{Na}}^m c_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^m = (c_b)^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01\n\\]\nSolve:\n- \\(c_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^m \\approx 0.0099\\) M (co-ion strongly excluded)\n- \\(c_{\\mathrm{Na}}^m \\approx 1.0099\\) M (counter-ion enriched)\n\nSo the **co-ion exclusion factor** is:\n\\[\n\\frac{c_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^m}{c_b} \\approx \\frac{0.0099}{0.1} \\approx 0.10\n\\]\ni.e., ~10\u00d7 lower co-ion concentration inside the membrane than outside, purely from Donnan + fixed charge. At lower external salinity (e.g., 10 mM), exclusion becomes much stronger.\n\nThis is the membrane analog of \u201cselectivity via transference number,\u201d but it\u2019s rooted in **equilibrium partitioning** plus electroneutrality.\n\n---\n\n## 3) What causes limiting/saturation behavior in membrane systems?\n\n### A. Electrodialysis / IEMs: limiting current from concentration polarization (CP)\n**Concentration polarization (define):** boundary-layer concentration gradients adjacent to the membrane caused by selective ion transport; creates a depleted layer on one side.\n\nClassical diffusion-limited current density:\n\\[\ni_{\\text{lim}} \\approx z F \\frac{D\\,c_b}{\\delta}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta\\) is hydrodynamic diffusion boundary layer thickness.\n\n**Example (typical ED):**\n- \\(D \\sim 1\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\) (NaCl in water)\n- \\(c_b = 0.01\\ \\text{M} = 10\\ \\text{mol/m}^3\\)\n- \\(\\delta = 100\\ \\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-4}\\ \\text{m}\\)\n- \\(z=1\\)\n\n\\[\ni_{\\text{lim}} \\approx 96485 \\times \\frac{10^{-9}\\times 10}{10^{-4}}\n\\approx 9.6\\ \\text{A/m}^2 \\approx 0.96\\ \\text{mA/cm}^2\n\\]\n\nThis is why ED stacks often operate with spacers/turbulence promoters to reduce \\(\\delta\\) and push \\(i_{\\text{lim}}\\) upward.\n\n**Beyond limiting (overlimiting current):** established mechanisms include\n- **electroconvection** (hydrodynamic instability driven by space charge),\n- **water splitting** at the membrane surface (generating H\\(^+\\)/OH\\(^-\\) that carry current),\n- **surface conduction** along charged interfaces (important at low bulk salinity; characterized by **Dukhin number**).\n\n### B. NF/RO: \u201climiting flux\u201d from CP + osmotic pressure + fouling/scaling\nIn pressure-driven membranes, \u201climiting\u201d often means **water flux stops increasing with pressure** because:\n- **CP raises local osmotic pressure** at the membrane surface: \\(\\pi(c_m)\\) increases, reducing effective driving force \\(\\Delta P-\\Delta\\pi\\).\n- **Gel/cake layer formation** (fouling) adds hydraulic resistance and can become the dominant \u201cmembrane.\u201d\n- **Scaling** (e.g., CaCO\\(_3\\), CaSO\\(_4\\)) creates a porous deposit and local supersaturation.\n\nA standard CP relation (film theory) for a rejected solute:\n\\[\n\\frac{c_m}{c_b} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{J_w}{k}\\right)\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is mass-transfer coefficient.\n\n**Example (RO/NF order-of-magnitude):**\n- \\(J_w = 20\\ \\text{LMH} \\approx 5.6\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m/s}\\)\n- \\(k = 2\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m/s}\\)\n\nThen \\(J_w/k \\approx 0.28\\), so \\(c_m/c_b \\approx e^{0.28}\\approx 1.32\\): a 32% surface concentration increase\u2014often enough to noticeably increase osmotic pressure and scaling risk.\n\n---\n\n## 4) One critical challenge (membrane ion transport)\n**Predicting selectivity and limiting behavior under realistic, multicomponent conditions.**  \nWe can model single salts reasonably, but real feeds have mixtures (Na\\(^+\\), Ca\\(^{2+}\\), Mg\\(^{2+}\\), Cl\\(^-\\), SO\\(_4^{2-}\\), organics). Challenges:\n- **Competitive partitioning** (Donnan + specific ion effects),\n- **Coupled transport** (water + ions + pH shifts),\n- **Fouling layers** that evolve and change effective charge/pore size,\n- **Non-ideal thermodynamics** (activities) at high ionic strength.\n\nThis is where electrochemistry\u2019s concentrated-solution formalism (activities, transference numbers) could strengthen membrane modeling\u2014membrane science sometimes still uses ideal approximations longer than it should.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Polite disagreement / nuance relative to Electrochemistry Scientist\nI agree strongly with the Chair\u2019s \u201celectrochemical potential gradient\u201d unifier and with the electrochemistry emphasis on **transference number**. One nuance: in membrane separations, \u201cselectivity\u201d is often **equilibrium partitioning + hindrance**, not only current partitioning. Two membranes can have similar \\(t_+^m\\) under current but very different **salt rejection** under pressure because convection/partitioning changes the story. So we should be careful not to collapse all selectivity into \\(t_+\\) unless we specify the operating mode (ED vs RO/NF).\n\nAlso, in ED/IEMs, \u201climiting current\u201d is often **external boundary-layer controlled** (CP), not membrane-bulk diffusion\u2014so improving membrane conductivity alone doesn\u2019t remove the limit; hydrodynamics does.\n\n---\n\n## Questions for Round 2 (to unify across fields)\n1. Can we agree on a shared definition of **selectivity** that distinguishes:\n   - **equilibrium selectivity** (partition coefficient / Donnan potential),\n   - **transport selectivity** (transference number / permeability ratio under driving force)?\n2. For the benchmark problem, can we include both:\n   - a **current-driven** case (ED-like, limiting current),\n   - a **pressure-driven** case (RO/NF-like, CP-limited flux),\n   so we don\u2019t bias the unified framework toward only electrochemical operation?"

Discrete-state / kinetic models (Eyring rate theory, Markov occupancy)\n**Assumptions:**\n- Channel has discrete binding sites; ions hop between them with rate constants \\(k\\) that depend on voltage and concentrations.\n- Often assumes quasi-equilibrium within wells and transition-state theory for barriers.\n\nA minimal 2\u20134 site \u201cknock-on\u201d model can reproduce:\n- high conductance,\n- strong selectivity,\n- saturation with concentration.\n\nThis is closer to how structural biologists think about selectivity filters: **free-energy landscape + occupancy**.\n\n---\n\n## 2) What determines ion selectivity, and how is it measured?\n\n### Core physical determinant (established for K\\(^+\\) vs Na\\(^+\\))\n**Selectivity is primarily a free-energy difference for transferring an ion from water into the filter**, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\Delta\\Delta G = \\left[\\Delta G(\\text{ion in filter}) - \\Delta G(\\text{ion in water})\\right]_{Na}\n-\\left[\\cdots\\right]_{K}\n\\]\nMechanistically, the K\\(^+\\) channel filter presents **carbonyl oxygens** arranged to coordinate a **dehydrated K\\(^+\\)** at ~2.8 \u00c5, mimicking its hydration shell. Na\\(^+\\) is smaller (~2.4 \u00c5 preferred coordination distance) and pays a larger penalty because the filter geometry and fluctuations do not stabilize it as well (plus stronger hydration of Na\\(^+\\) makes dehydration costlier).\n\n**Where selectivity occurs:** predominantly **in the selectivity filter** (mid-pore), not at entry/exit, though vestibule charges can tune local concentrations (electrostatic focusing).\n\n### How we measure selectivity (quantitative)\n1. **Reversal potential shifts** under bi-ionic conditions (classic electrophysiology):\n   - Measure \\(E_\\text{rev}\\) when only ion A is outside and ion B inside.\n   - Use GHK to infer permeability ratio:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{P_A}{P_B} = \\frac{[B]_\\text{in}}{[A]_\\text{out}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F E_\\text{rev}}{RT}\\right)\n     \\]\n     (for monovalent ions; with appropriate form).\n2. **Conductance ratios** at fixed conditions (less clean because conductance depends on occupancy and barriers, not just selectivity).\n3. **Structural + computation:** MD free-energy profiles (PMFs) and alchemical free energies; these are powerful but model-dependent (force fields, polarization).\n\n### Quantitative example: K\\(^+\\) vs Na\\(^+\\) selectivity\n**Established experimental fact:** many K\\(^+\\) channels have \\(P_K/P_{Na} \\sim 10^2\u201310^4\\) depending on channel and conditions.\n\nConvert that to a free-energy discrimination (equilibrium-like estimate):\n\\[\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_K}{P_{Na}}\\right)\n\\]\nAt 298 K, \\(RT \\approx 2.48\\) kJ/mol:\n- If \\(P_K/P_{Na} = 10^3\\): \\(\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx 2.48 \\times \\ln(1000)\\approx 17\\) kJ/mol (~7 \\(k_BT\\)).\nThat\u2019s a useful \u201ctarget number\u201d for synthetic analogs: **only ~15\u201320 kJ/mol** of differential stabilization can yield 1000:1 selectivity.\n\n**Ca\\(^{2+}\\) channels (brief):** selectivity often arises from high-field-strength acidic residues (E/D rings) that preferentially stabilize divalents; here electrostatics + dehydration + multi-ion competition matter.\n\n---\n\n## 3) What causes limiting/saturation behavior in channels? (with numbers)\n\n### A. Saturation with concentration: occupancy-limited permeation (established)\nMany channels show Michaelis\u2013Menten-like saturation of conductance vs concentration because the pore has a finite number of binding sites; once occupied, increasing bulk concentration doesn\u2019t increase throughput proportionally.\n\nA simple kinetic form:\n\\[\ni(c) \\approx i_\\text{max}\\frac{c}{K_m + c}\n\\]\nInterpretation: \\(K_m\\) reflects the concentration at which the pore is half-occupied / half-maximal current.\n\n### B. Diffusion access resistance (established, often overlooked)\nEven if the pore itself is fast, supply of ions to the pore mouth can limit current (\u201caccess resistance\u201d). For a circular pore of radius \\(a\\) in an infinite medium of conductivity \\(\\kappa\\):\n\\[\nR_\\text{access} \\approx \\frac{1}{4 a \\kappa}\n\\]\nThis is directly analogous to boundary-layer limits in membranes/electrochemistry, but at nm scale.\n\n**Order-of-magnitude number:**\n- \\(a = 0.5\\) nm \\(=5\\times 10^{-10}\\) m\n- \\(\\kappa \\sim 1\\) S/m (\u2248 100 mM KCl; rough)\n\\[\nR_\\text{access} \\approx \\frac{1}{4(5\\times 10^{-10})(1)} \\approx 5\\times 10^8\\ \\Omega\n\\]\nAt \\(V=100\\) mV, \\(i \\sim 0.1/5\\times 10^8 \\approx 2\\times 10^{-10}\\) A = **0.2 nA = 200 pA**.  \nThat\u2019s an upper bound scale; real single-channel currents are typically **1\u201320 pA** at 100 mV for many K\\(^+\\) channels (conductance ~10\u2013200 pS), implying that **in-pore barriers/occupancy and protein dynamics** usually dominate over pure access resistance\u2014but access can matter for very wide/high-conductance pores (porins) or at low salt.\n\n### C. Voltage-dependent saturation / block (established in many channels)\nAt high voltages, current can saturate or even decrease due to:\n- **ion depletion** near the pore (local CP),\n- **voltage-dependent block** by permeant or non-permeant ions (e.g., Mg\\(^{2+}\\) block of NMDA receptors; polyamine block in inward rectifier K\\(^+\\) channels),\n- **gating** (open probability changes with voltage/ligand), which is a biological \u201climit\u201d absent in passive membranes.\n\n### Concrete throughput number (convert pA to ions/s)\nTake a typical single-channel current \\(i = 10\\) pA at 100 mV:\n\\[\n\\text{ions/s} = \\frac{i}{e} \\approx \\frac{10\\times 10^{-12}}{1.6\\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 6\\times 10^7\\ \\text{ions/s}\n\\]\nThat\u2019s a striking biological benchmark: **tens of millions of ions per second through a single protein**, while maintaining high selectivity.\n\n---\n\n## 4) One critical challenge (biology \u2194 synthetic translation)\n**Predicting selectivity and conductance from structure across regimes.**  \nWe can often rationalize selectivity qualitatively from structures, but quantitatively predicting both:\n- **high selectivity** (e.g., \\(10^3\\) K/Na) and\n- **high conductance** (pA currents)\nfrom first principles remains hard because it requires capturing:\n- dehydration/rehydration energetics,\n- multi-ion correlations (\u201cknock-on\u201d),\n- protein polarization and dynamics,\n- realistic boundary conditions (access resistance, surface charge).\n\nThis is where I see synergy with membrane science and electrochemistry: they have mature treatments of **boundary layers, limiting currents, and non-ideal thermodynamics**, while biology contributes **angstrom-scale coordination chemistry** and **gating**.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Polite disagreement / nuance with earlier speakers\n- I agree with the Chair that \\(\\nabla \\mu_i\\) is the universal driver. Where I diverge is that in **narrow biological filters**, \\(\\mu_i^{\\mathrm{ex}}\\) is not a small correction\u2014it is *the* story (dehydration + site binding + correlations). Treating it as an effective permeability \\(P_i\\) (GHK) is useful phenomenology but can hide the mechanism.\n- On \u201climiting current\u201d: in channels, the analog exists (access resistance / local depletion), but **gating** introduces an additional saturation mechanism: the channel can simply spend less time open at certain voltages/ligand states, so macroscopic current saturates even if single-channel permeation would not.\n\n---\n\n## Questions to guide Round 2 (to connect fields)\n1. For the benchmark nanopore problem: can we explicitly separate **(i) access/boundary-layer limitation** from **(ii) in-pore limitation** by defining two resistances in series (bulk + pore), analogous to electrochemistry\u2019s solution resistance + charge-transfer resistance?\n2. Can membrane/iontronics colleagues specify when their selectivity is mainly **partitioning (Donnan/solvation)** versus **kinetic barrier**? In channels, that distinction maps cleanly onto \u201cbinding selectivity\u201d vs \u201cpermeation selectivity,\u201d and they can differ.\n3. Do we want to include **gating** as a fourth \u201cmechanism\u201d beyond diffusion/migration/convection\u2014i.e., time-dependent permeability \\(P(t)\\)\u2014or keep Round 1 strictly passive transport?"

The total stored ionic charge:\n\\[\nQ \\approx C^* V_G \\,(\\text{volume})\n\\]\nand the characteristic switching time is often approximated by an **RC diffusion** time:\n\\[\n\\tau \\sim \\frac{L^2}{D_{\\text{ion}}}\n\\quad \\text{or} \\quad\n\\tau \\sim R_{\\text{ion}} C_{\\text{vol}}\n\\]\ndepending on geometry and whether ionic transport or ionic resistance dominates.\n\n**Breakdown of these assumptions (important in iontronics):**\n- **Nonlinear ion mobility** in polymers (depends on hydration, segmental motion).\n- **Faradaic reactions** at electrodes (water electrolysis, redox side reactions) violate \u201cpure capacitive gating.\u201d\n- **Strong ion-specific effects** (Hofmeister series) change swelling, \\(D\\), and effective \\(C^*\\).\n- **Space-charge / depletion** in ion-selective structures (ionic diodes) makes electroneutrality invalid locally.\n\n---\n\n## 2) What determines ion selectivity in iontronic systems, and how measured?\n\nIontronics spans two selectivity notions:\n\n### (i) Selectivity of **ionic transport** (which ions move where)\n**Determinants (established):**\n- **Fixed charge** in polyelectrolytes (e.g., PSS\\(^-\\) in PEDOT:PSS) \u2192 Donnan exclusion of co-ions.\n- **Solvation and polymer affinity** (partition coefficient): ions with different hydration energies partition differently into polymer/ion gel.\n- **Sterics** in nanoporous iontronic diodes.\n\n**How measured:**\n- **Transference number \\(t_+\\)** in polymer/gel (electrochemistry methods: eNMR, Hittorf; in solids: potentiostatic polarization with care).\n- **Permeability / uptake**: ion content in polymer via ICP-MS, XPS depth profiling, EQCM (electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance), or optical methods.\n- **Selectivity ratio** in ionic diodes: rectification ratio and ion-specific current under symmetric conditions.\n\n### (ii) Selectivity of **ion-to-electron coupling** (which ions most strongly modulate electronic conduction)\nThis is more \u201ciontronic-specific\u201d: two ions may carry similar ionic current but produce very different electronic modulation because they differ in:\n- insertion kinetics,\n- swelling-induced morphology changes,\n- redox potential shifts,\n- trapping/complexation.\n\n**Quantitative example (OECT gating charge):**\nTypical PEDOT:PSS has \\(C^* \\sim 10\u201340\\ \\text{F/cm}^3\\) (order-of-magnitude established in literature).\nFor a channel volume \\(V = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\times 10\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\times 0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m}^3 = 1\\times 10^{-10}\\ \\text{cm}^3\\),\nat \\(V_G = 0.5\\) V:\n\\[\nQ \\approx C^* V_G V \\sim (20)(0.5)(10^{-10}) \\approx 1\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{C}\n\\]\nThat corresponds to:\n\\[\nN \\approx \\frac{Q}{e} \\sim \\frac{10^{-9}}{1.6\\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 6\\times 10^9\\ \\text{ions}\n\\]\nSo even \u201csmall\u201d OECTs move **billions of ions per switching event**, which is why ion dynamics dominate speed and memory.\n\n---\n\n## 3) What causes limiting/saturation behavior in iontronic devices?\n\nIontronics has *two* saturation types: **ionic transport limits** and **electronic modulation limits**.\n\n### A. Ionic transport limits (device physics analog of limiting current)\n1. **Ion depletion / concentration polarization** in the electrolyte near the channel or gate (especially in small volumes or ion-selective interfaces). This mirrors membrane/electrochemistry limiting current.\n2. **Finite ionic conductivity** of ion gels/solid electrolytes \u2192 ohmic drop limits effective gate field.\n3. **Diffusion-limited ion penetration** into thick channels:\n   \\[\n   \\tau \\sim \\frac{L^2}{D}\n   \\]\n   Example: \\(L=100\\) nm, \\(D=10^{-11}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\) (slow in polymers) gives\n   \\[\n   \\tau \\sim \\frac{10^{-14}}{10^{-11}} = 10^{-3}\\ \\text{s} = 1\\ \\text{ms}\n   \\]\n   If \\(L=1\\ \\mu\\text{m}\\), \\(\\tau\\sim 0.1\\) s. This is a real design constraint for neuromorphic time constants.\n\n### B. Saturation of electronic response (transistor-specific)\nEven if ions keep moving, the **electronic conductance change saturates** when:\n- the channel is fully dedoped/doped (finite density of redox sites),\n- percolation pathways collapse (morphology limit),\n- contact resistance dominates.\n\nIn OECT transfer curves, you often see \\(I_D\\) saturate at high \\(|V_G|\\) because the channel reaches a minimum conductivity state.\n\n### C. Faradaic side reactions (hard limit)\nAt gate/electrolyte or channel/electrolyte interfaces, exceeding the electrochemical stability window causes:\n- water electrolysis (in aqueous),\n- irreversible redox of polymer,\n- gas formation and delamination.\nThis sets a practical voltage ceiling (~\u00b10.6\u20130.8 V vs Ag/AgCl in water, system-dependent).\n\n---\n\n## 4) One critical challenge (iontronics)\n**Separating \u201cpure electrostatic/EDL gating\u201d from \u201ctrue electrochemical doping\u201d and quantifying ion-specific effects.**  \nIn many papers, the same device is described as capacitive, faradaic, or mixed depending on measurement protocol. We need:\n- standardized impedance + transient protocols,\n- operando ion quantification (EQCM, spectroscopy),\n- models that include **non-ideal thermodynamics** (\\(\\mu^{ex}\\)) and **mechanics** (swelling) because these strongly affect \\(D\\), \\(C^*\\), and retention.\n\nThis is directly relevant to neuromorphic functions: slow ion motion and trapping create memory, but without mechanistic clarity it\u2019s hard to engineer stability and reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Polite disagreement / nuance with other speakers\n- I agree with electrochemistry/membranes that Nernst\u2013Planck + \\(\\nabla \\mu\\) is the common core. Where iontronics differs is that **the observable is often electronic current**, not ionic current. So \u201climiting current\u201d may appear as a saturation in \\(I_D\\) even when ionic flux is still increasing\u2014because the channel has reached a redox/charge-storage limit.\n- With biology: I like the \u201cresistances in series\u201d framing (access + pore). In iontronics, we similarly have **electrolyte resistance + interfacial impedance + bulk polymer diffusion** in series/parallel. But unlike passive pores, the polymer\u2019s state changes (history dependence), so the \u201cresistance network\u201d is time-varying\u2014this is the memristive element.\n\n---\n\n## Questions for Round 2 (to unify benchmark + terminology)\n1. Can we define a shared selectivity taxonomy:\n   - **partition selectivity** (Donnan/solvation),\n   - **mobility selectivity** (different \\(D_i\\)),\n   - **coupling selectivity** (how strongly a given ion modulates electronic carriers)?\n2. For the benchmark nanopore/membrane problem, can we add an \u201ciontronic readout\u201d layer: e.g., a mixed conductor whose conductivity depends on local ion concentration \\( \\sigma_e(c_i)\\), so we can compare how each field would model the same coupled system?\n3. For limiting behavior, can we explicitly separate:\n   - **transport-limited** (depletion, diffusion),\n   - **capacity-limited** (finite charge storage \\(C^*\\)),\n   - **stability-limited** (electrochemical window / side reactions)?"

That\u2019s a solid unifying backbone.\n- **Quantitative anchors were provided** in each domain (ED limiting current estimate; battery diffusion-limited current; channel ions/s; OECT charge per switch). This meets the \u201cnumbers, not just trends\u201d rule.\n- **Clear recognition of breakdown regimes:** concentrated electrolytes (electrochemistry), nanoconfinement/correlations (biology), CP/overlimiting mechanisms (membranes), and mixed ionic\u2013electronic coupling + side reactions (iontronics).\n\n---\n\n## Cross-cutting concerns (2\u20133 key issues to resolve in Round 2)\n\n### 1) \u201cMaster equation\u201d agreement is superficial unless we standardize **closures**\nEveryone wrote some variant of Nernst\u2013Planck, but the physics lives in what gets hidden in:\n- \\(D_i(c,\\text{polymer},\\text{pore})\\),\n- activity \\(a_i\\) vs concentration \\(c_i\\),\n- excess chemical potential \\(\\mu_i^{ex}\\),\n- electroneutrality vs Poisson,\n- boundary conditions (Donnan, Butler\u2013Volmer, kinetic hopping, etc.).\n\n**Request for clarity:** For each field, specify *one explicit closure* you consider \u201cstandard\u201d and list what it neglects. Example: \u201cWe assume ideal \\(a_i=c_i\\), constant \\(D_i\\), electroneutral bulk, and Donnan equilibrium at interfaces.\u201d Without this, \u201csame equation\u201d risks being a rhetorical alignment rather than a predictive one.\n\n**Suggestion:** In Round 2, force each expert to map their model to:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{J}_i = -\\frac{D_i c_i}{RT}\\nabla\\left(RT\\ln a_i + z_iF\\phi + \\mu_i^{ex}\\right) + c_i\\mathbf{u}\n\\]\nand then state explicitly whether \\(a_i\\) is ideal, whether \\(\\mu_i^{ex}\\) is neglected or parameterized, and how \\(\\phi\\) is obtained.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Selectivity is being conflated across **three distinct concepts**\nRight now \u201cselectivity\u201d is used to mean:\n1. **Equilibrium partitioning** (Donnan/steric/solvation): membrane \\(c_i^m/c_i^s\\), RO/NF rejection.\n2. **Transport selectivity under current** (transference number \\(t_+\\), permselectivity).\n3. **Kinetic/energetic discrimination** (channels: \\(\\Delta\\Delta G\\), permeability ratios from reversal potentials).\n4. (Iontronics adds a fourth) **Functional selectivity**: which ions most strongly modulate electronic conductivity.\n\nThese are not interchangeable. Two systems can have strong Donnan exclusion but weak transference selectivity under operating conditions (e.g., due to co-ion leakage, water splitting, or convection). Likewise, a channel can have huge \\(P_K/P_{Na}\\) but modest conductance differences depending on occupancy.\n\n**Request for clarity:** Each expert should provide:\n- the exact selectivity metric used (e.g., \\(P_K/P_{Na}\\), \\(t_+\\), \\(R\\), \\(\\alpha\\)),\n- the operating mode (voltage-driven, pressure-driven, equilibrium),\n- and whether the metric is **equilibrium** or **nonequilibrium**.\n\n**Suggestion:** Adopt a standardized reporting table in Round 2:\n- Metric name + formula\n- Measurement method\n- Regime (steady/transient; dilute/concentrated)\n- Typical value range\n\n---\n\n### 3) \u201cLimiting current/flux\u201d mechanisms were stated, but **regime boundaries** are underspecified\nSeveral limiting mechanisms were mentioned (diffusion boundary layer, salt depletion, access resistance, capacity limits, side reactions, gating), but the talks often didn\u2019t specify *when* each dominates.\n\nExamples needing sharper qualification:\n- **Electrochemistry:** The diffusion-limited estimate used \\(\\delta=100\\,\\mu\\)m and \\(D=10^{-10}\\) m\u00b2/s to get ~10 mA/cm\u00b2. That\u2019s plausible, but in porous electrodes the relevant length scale is not a simple \\(\\delta\\). Also, for Li electrolytes, \\(D\\) and \\(t_+\\) are concentration-dependent; \u201climiting\u201d can be soft and coupled to conductivity collapse. Please specify a criterion (e.g., \\(c\\to 0\\) at interface, or \\(\\text{Da}_\\text{ion}\\gtrsim 1\\)).\n- **Membranes:** The ED limiting current estimate is fine, but overlimiting mechanisms were listed without indicating which are dominant under what salinity, spacer geometry, and membrane charge. \u201cElectroconvection vs water splitting vs surface conduction\u201d needs at least one discriminating condition or dimensionless number (e.g., Dukhin number, Pe, or a threshold current relative to \\(i_\\text{lim}\\)).\n- **Biology:** Access resistance estimate gives an upper-bound current (~200 pA) but then typical currents are 1\u201320 pA; the gap is attributed to \u201cin-pore barriers/occupancy.\u201d That\u2019s reasonable, but it would be stronger to quantify typical single-channel conductance and compare to access-limited conductance for a realistic pore radius and solution conductivity, to show which resistance dominates.\n- **Iontronics:** Three \u201climits\u201d were named (transport, capacity, stability), which is good. But the diffusion time estimate \\(\\tau\\sim L^2/D\\) depends critically on what \\(D\\) is in the polymer (often varies orders of magnitude with hydration and ion identity). Provide a measured \\(D\\) range and how it was obtained (EIS fitting? tracer? transient response?).\n\n**Suggestion:** In Round 2, each field should present a **dominance map**: a simple inequality or dimensionless number that says \u201cmechanism A dominates when \u2026\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## Field-specific questions (2\u20133 per speaker) to strengthen rigor\n\n### Electrochemistry Scientist\n1. You quoted \\(t_+^0 \\sim 0.2\u20130.4\\) for carbonate electrolytes. Please specify **method and reference frame** (solvent frame vs COM) and give one concrete literature example (electrolyte composition + temperature).\n2. Your limiting current estimate assumes a planar diffusion layer. For a porous electrode/separator, what is your effective transport length and tortuosity model? Can you provide a comparable estimate using \\(D_\\text{eff}=D\\varepsilon/\\tau\\)?\n3. Clarify when you expect **space-charge/overlimiting** phenomena to matter in battery-like systems (charged separators? solid electrolytes?).\n\n### Membrane Science Expert\n1. In the Donnan example, you assumed ideality and symmetric 1:1 salt. How sensitive is the co-ion exclusion factor to **activity coefficients** at 0.1 M and to multivalent ions?\n2. For NF/RO, you used film theory \\(c_m/c_b=\\exp(J_w/k)\\). Please specify typical \\(k\\) ranges and how \\(k\\) is measured/estimated (Sherwood correlations, spacer geometry).\n3. Overlimiting current: can you give one quantitative criterion (e.g., Dukhin number threshold) for when **surface conduction** is non-negligible?\n\n### Biological Ion Transport Scientist\n1. You used \\(\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx RT\\ln(P_K/P_{Na})\\). That implicitly treats permeability ratio as an equilibrium partition ratio. Under what conditions is that mapping justified, and when does it fail (e.g., multi-ion occupancy, kinetic barriers)?\n2. Provide one explicit example channel (e.g., KcsA, Kv1.2) with typical \\(g\\) and \\(P_K/P_{Na}\\) to ground the numbers.\n3. Distinguish \u201csaturation due to occupancy\u201d from \u201csaturation due to gating\u201d experimentally\u2014what protocol separates them?\n\n### Iontronics Scientist\n1. The \\(C^*\\sim 10\u201340\\) F/cm\u00b3 claim is plausible but broad. Please cite a representative measurement method (EIS, CV, transient) and specify conditions (electrolyte, bias range).\n2. Your \u201ccoupling selectivity\u201d concept is useful but currently qualitative. Can you propose a **metric** (e.g., \\(\\Delta\\sigma_e\\) per inserted charge, or \\(\\partial I_D/\\partial Q\\)) and how to measure it?\n3. Clarify when \u201celectroneutrality except EDL\u201d fails in OECT channels during fast switching\u2014do you ever need Poisson explicitly, or is a quasi-neutral diffusion\u2013reaction model sufficient?\n\n---\n\n## Concrete recommendation for Round 2 (to improve scientific rigor)\n1. **Adopt a shared reporting table** for each field: (Equation + closures), (Selectivity metric + method), (Limiting mechanism + criterion + number).\n2. **Benchmark problem must specify geometry and boundary conditions** (reservoir concentrations, applied voltage/pressure, fixed charge density, pore size, whether reactions occur). Otherwise comparisons will be non-falsifiable.\n3. Require each expert to state **one falsifiable prediction** their model makes for the benchmark (e.g., scaling of limiting current with \\(c_b\\), dependence of selectivity on fixed charge \\(X\\), or switching time scaling with \\(L^2\\)).\n\nIf we do those three, Round 2 can move from \u201cparallel narratives\u201d to a genuinely comparable, testable framework."

Provide one inequality.\n\n#### B) Membrane Science Expert \u2014 overlimiting discrimination + selectivity mapping\n1. For an IEM in ED, give a **typical fixed charge \\(X\\)** and **membrane thickness \\(L\\)** you consider canonical, and a measured **permselectivity \\(\\alpha\\)** at a stated salinity.  \n2. Provide one **dimensionless criterion** (Dukhin number, Pe, etc.) you use to decide when **surface conduction** or **electroconvection** matters beyond \\(i_\\text{lim}\\).  \n3.

Pick one channel (e.g., KcsA or a voltage-gated K channel): provide **single-channel conductance \\(g\\)**, **\\(P_K/P_{Na}\\)**, and conditions (salt, voltage).  \n2. Give your preferred **minimal model** for that channel: (i) GHK/PNP with an effective \\(P_i\\), or (ii) discrete occupancy model. State what parameter(s) represent \\(\\mu^{ex}\\).  \n3. Provide a quantitative way to separate **access resistance** vs **in-pore limitation** experimentally (e.g., salt dependence scaling, mutational changes, vestibule charge changes).\n\n#### D) Iontronics Scientist \u2014 define a metric for \u201ccoupling selectivity\u201d\n1. For a representative OECT (material + electrolyte), provide measured **\\(C^*\\)** and how it was extracted (EIS, transient, CV), plus a typical **\\(D_\\text{ion}\\)** estimate and method.  \n2. Propose a **coupling selectivity metric** that is experimentally accessible, e.g.  \n   \\[\n   S_i = \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_e}{\\partial Q_i}\\quad \\text{or}\\quad \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial Q_i}\n   \\]\n   and describe a protocol to isolate \\(Q_i\\) by ion identity (swap electrolytes, tracer, EQCM).  \n3.

But at **SEI** or **single-ion conductors**, partitioning is strong.

A practical battery \u201climit\u201d is often defined by a voltage cutoff rather than strict \\(c=0\\). For the benchmark, we should keep the strict \\(c\\to 0\\) definition to compare across fields.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Falsifiable predictions for the benchmark problems\n\n### Benchmark A (voltage/current-driven charged pore/membrane)\n**Prediction A1 (limiting current scaling):**\n\\[\ni_\\text{lim} \\propto c_b \\quad \\text{and}\\quad i_\\text{lim}\\propto \\frac{1}{\\delta}\n\\]\nThis should hold across electrochemistry and membrane ED in the diffusion-limited regime. Deviations indicate overlimiting mechanisms (electroconvection/surface conduction) or non-idealities.\n\n**Prediction A2 (role of transference number in concentration polarization):**\nAt fixed applied current \\(i\\), the magnitude of salt concentration gradient scales with \\((1-t_+^0)\\). In Newman form, the source term in salt conservation is \\(\\propto (1-t_+^0)\\,di_e/dx\\). Thus, for two electrolytes identical except \\(t_+^0\\),\n\\[\n\\left|\\nabla c\\right| \\text{ increases as } (1-t_+^0)\n\\]\nSo moving from \\(t_+^0=0.3\\) to \\(t_+^0=0.7\\) should reduce concentration polarization by roughly a factor \\(\\sim (0.3)/(0.7)\\approx 0.43\\) (order-of-magnitude expectation).\n\n### Benchmark B (pressure-driven with convection)\nElectrochemistry doesn\u2019t usually operate pressure-driven, but the same framework predicts that adding convection introduces a P\u00e9clet number:\n\\[\n\\text{Pe}=\\frac{uL}{D}\n\\]\n**Prediction B1:** when \\(\\text{Pe}\\gg 1\\), convection dominates axial transport and suppresses axial concentration gradients; selectivity then depends more on partitioning/hindrance than on migration.\n\nI\u2019ll defer detailed RO/NF rejection predictions to the membrane expert; my contribution is mainly the coupling of migration and diffusion under current.\n\n---\n\n## 5) One polite disagreement / caution for Round 2\nI support the Chair\u2019s decision to use a shared benchmark, but I want to flag a potential pitfall:\n\n- If the benchmark pore is **strongly charged and nanoscopic**, then **electroneutrality-based porous-electrode equations** (my standard battery closure) will not apply; we must switch to **Poisson\u2013Nernst\u2013Planck** or modified PNP. That\u2019s fine, but we should be explicit that \u201cbattery-standard\u201d models are a *coarse-grained limit* of the more general framework.\n\nSo I suggest we define **two benchmark pore sizes**:\n1. **Mesoscale (electroneutral bulk valid):** \\(r_p \\gg \\lambda_D\\) (say \\(r_p \\ge 10\\) nm at 10 mM).\n2. **Nanoscale (Poisson needed):** \\(r_p \\sim \\lambda_D\\) (1\u20132 nm at 100 mM).\n\nThat will let biology/membranes/iontronics operate in their natural regime without forcing electrochemistry into an invalid closure.\n\n---\n\n## 6) What I need from others (to complete the unified comparison)\n- From **membranes**: a representative fixed charge \\(X\\) and a mapping from permselectivity \\(\\alpha\\) to an effective counter-ion transport number \\(t_+^m\\) under current.\n- From **biology**: a clear statement of when permeability ratios can be interpreted as \\(\\Delta\\Delta G\\) (equilibrium-like) versus when multi-ion kinetics dominates.\n- From **iontronics**: a quantitative coupling metric \\(S_i=\\partial \\sigma_e/\\partial Q_i\\) and a protocol to measure \\(Q_i\\) without conflating it with side reactions.\n\nThat\u2019s all from my side for Round 2."

IEM/ED closure set (what I consider \u201cstandard\u201d)\n**Assumptions:**\n1. **Steady state** for limiting-current analysis.\n2. **Electroneutrality in membrane bulk**: \\(\\sum_i z_i c_i + z_f X = 0\\). (We do *not* solve Poisson inside the membrane bulk.)\n3. **Local equilibrium at interfaces** \u2192 **Donnan partitioning** (electrochemical potential continuity).\n4. **Ideal solution** in the simplest limiting-current derivation: \\(a_i \\approx c_i\\). (Non-ideality can be added via activities; important above ~0.1\u20130.5 M.)\n5. **No convection inside membrane** for salt (reasonable for IEM salt transport); water transport exists but is secondary for the limiting-current definition.\n6. **Boundary layer transport** described by film theory (diffusion layer thickness \\(\\delta\\)).\n\n**Equations:**\n- In membrane (1D):\n  \\[\n  J_i = -D_i\\frac{dc_i}{dx} - \\frac{z_i D_i F}{RT}c_i\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\n  \\]\n- Electroneutrality:\n  \\[\n  c_+^m - c_-^m = X \\quad (\\text{for 1:1 salt in a CEM})\n  \\]\n- Donnan at interfaces:\n  \\[\n  \\mu_i^s = \\mu_i^m \\Rightarrow\n  \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_i^m}{a_i^s}\\right) + \\frac{z_iF}{RT}\\Delta\\phi_D + \\frac{\\Delta \\mu_i^{ex}}{RT}=0\n  \\]\n  where \\(\\Delta \\mu_i^{ex}\\) captures steric/solvation/specific adsorption (often neglected in first pass).\n\n**Where this breaks:**\n- At high current near the depleted side: **extended space charge** and **water splitting** can occur; electroneutrality fails locally and Poisson (or effective space-charge models) becomes necessary.\n\n## B2. NF closure set (DSPM-type)\n**Assumptions:**\n1. Continuum in pores; steady state.\n2. Pore flow exists: convection term included.\n3. Mean-field electrostatics; often electroneutrality in pore is *not* assumed\u2014models may solve a simplified Poisson or use Donnan approximations depending on pore size vs Debye length.\n4. Hindrance factors \\(K_{d,i},K_{c,i}\\) represent steric effects; charge represented via surface charge or fixed charge density.\n\n**Equation (pore-averaged):**\n\\[\nJ_i = -K_{d,i}D_i\\frac{dc_i}{dx}\n-\\frac{z_i K_{d,i}D_iF}{RT}c_i\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\n+K_{c,i}c_i v\n\\]\n\n---\n\n# C) Selectivity metrics + mapping to transport numbers\n\n## C1. Partition selectivity (required)\nFor IEMs, partition selectivity is largely Donnan-driven. A useful measurable proxy is the **co-ion concentration in membrane** (via sorption experiments) or Donnan potential inferred from membrane potential.\n\nExample (same as Round 1 but now framed as \u201cpartition selectivity\u201d):\n- \\(X=1\\) M, \\(c_b=0.1\\) M NaCl \u2192 \\(c_-^m \\approx 0.01\\) M (co-ion exclusion factor ~0.1).\n\n## C2. Transport selectivity (required): permselectivity \\(\\alpha\\) and its relation to \\(t_+^m\\)\nFor a **cation-exchange membrane** in a 1:1 electrolyte, a common approximation is:\n\\[\n\\alpha \\approx 2t_+^m - 1\n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\nt_+^m \\approx \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}\n\\]\nThis comes from relating membrane potential to the difference in counter-/co-ion transport numbers under ideal conditions.\n\nSo if \\(\\alpha = 0.95\\),\n\\[\nt_+^m \\approx \\frac{1+0.95}{2}=0.975\n\\]\nInterpretation: ~97.5% of current in the membrane is carried by counter-ions (Na\\(^+\\) in a CEM), i.e., **membrane behaves nearly single-ion conducting**.\n\n**Caveat (important):** this mapping is most valid in dilute solutions and when water splitting and co-ion leakage are negligible. At higher salinity, co-ion sorption increases and \\(t_+^m\\) drops.\n\nThis directly answers the electrochemistry scientist\u2019s request: yes, we can map \\(\\alpha\\) to a transport-number-like quantity, but we must state the assumptions.\n\n---\n\n# D) Limiting current / saturation: criterion + number + regime discriminator\n\n## D1. ED limiting current (boundary-layer controlled)\n**Criterion:** depleted-side concentration at membrane surface approaches zero: \\(c_{m,s}\\to 0\\).\n\nClassical:\n\\[\ni_\\text{lim} \\approx zF\\frac{D c_b}{\\delta}\n\\]\n**Representative number (NaCl in water):**\n- \\(D = 1\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}\\)\n- \\(c_b = 0.01\\ \\text{M} = 10\\ \\text{mol/m}^3\\)\n- \\(\\delta = 100\\ \\mu\\text{m}\\)\n\n\\[\ni_\\text{lim}\\approx 9.6\\ \\text{A/m}^2 \\approx 0.96\\ \\text{mA/cm}^2\n\\]\n\nThis is a clean, falsifiable benchmark and matches typical ED limiting-current magnitudes at 10 mM.\n\n## D2. Overlimiting discrimination: when does surface conduction matter? (dimensionless criterion)\nA standard discriminator is the **Dukhin number** (define it):\n- **Dukhin number (Du)** = ratio of surface to bulk conduction in a channel/pore/boundary layer.\n\nOne common form (for a slit/channel of half-height \\(h\\)):\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Du} \\sim \\frac{\\kappa_s}{\\kappa_b h}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\kappa_s\\) is surface conductivity (S), \\(\\kappa_b\\) bulk conductivity (S/m).\n\n**Interpretation:**  \n- If \\(\\mathrm{Du} \\ll 1\\): bulk conduction dominates; classical limiting current applies.\n- If \\(\\mathrm{Du} \\gtrsim 1\\): surface conduction can sustain current beyond diffusion limit (one route to overlimiting).\n\n**Practical statement (not overclaiming):** In ED with typical spacers and moderate salinity (\u226510 mM), overlimiting is often dominated by **electroconvection** rather than pure surface conduction; at very low salinity (\u22641 mM) and strongly charged surfaces, surface conduction becomes more important. Exact thresholds depend on geometry and charge; Du provides the correct organizing principle.\n\n## D3. NF/RO \u201climiting flux\u201d (CP + osmotic pressure + fouling)\nFor pressure-driven systems, the \u201climit\u201d is often when increasing \\(\\Delta P\\) no longer increases \\(J_w\\) because \\(\\Delta\\pi(c_m)\\) rises via CP and/or a cake layer forms.\n\nFilm theory:\n\\[\n\\frac{c_m}{c_b}=\\exp\\left(\\frac{J_w}{k}\\right)\n\\]\n**Falsifiable scaling:** at fixed hydrodynamics (fixed \\(k\\)), \\(c_m\\) grows exponentially with \\(J_w\\), so osmotic penalty grows nonlinearly\u2014this is why flux \u201csaturates.\u201d\n\n---\n\n# E) Falsifiable predictions for the benchmark problems\n\n## Benchmark A (voltage/current-driven charged pore/membrane)\n**Prediction M1 (limiting current scaling):**\n\\[\ni_\\text{lim} \\propto \\frac{D c_b}{\\delta}\n\\]\nSame as electrochemistry; if experiments show \\(i_\\text{lim}\\) not linear in \\(c_b\\), it signals non-idealities, electroconvection, or water splitting.\n\n**Prediction M2 (effect of fixed charge on transport selectivity):**\nAt fixed external salinity, increasing \\(X\\) increases co-ion exclusion and increases \\(t_+^m\\) toward 1. In the Donnan limit for 1:1 salt, co-ion concentration scales roughly as:\n\\[\nc_-^m \\sim \\frac{c_b^2}{X}\\quad (\\text{for } X\\gg c_b)\n\\]\nSo co-ion leakage decreases ~inversely with \\(X\\). That\u2019s a clear, testable scaling in the partitioning regime.\n\n## Benchmark B (pressure-driven)\n**Prediction M3 (CP scaling):**\nAt fixed \\(k\\), the surface concentration ratio obeys:\n\\[\n\\ln(c_m/c_b) \\propto J_w\n\\]\nSo plotting \\(\\ln(c_m/c_b)\\) vs \\(J_w\\) should be linear with slope \\(1/k\\) in the film-theory regime.\n\n---\n\n# F) Polite disagreement / refinement to Electrochemistry Round 2\nI agree with the electrochemistry suggestion to define two pore-size regimes (electroneutral vs Poisson). I\u2019d add a membrane-specific nuance:\n\n- Even when \\(r_p \\gg \\lambda_D\\), **electroneutrality can still fail near the depleted interface at high current** (extended space charge). So the \u201cPoisson-needed\u201d regime is not only \u201csmall pores,\u201d but also \u201chigh driving force near ion-selective interfaces.\u201d For the benchmark, we should specify both:\n  1) geometric criterion \\(r_p/\\lambda_D\\), and  \n  2) operating criterion \\(i/i_\\text{lim}\\) (e.g., Poisson/space-charge effects become important as \\(i\\to i_\\text{lim}\\) and beyond).\n\n---\n\n# G) What I need from others for Round 2 completion\n- From **electrochemistry**: a concrete \\(\\chi(c)\\) (thermodynamic factor) value or curve for the chosen electrolyte, because membrane models often assume ideality and this is a key bridge.\n- From **biology**: a mapping of \u201coccupancy-limited\u201d saturation to an effective \\(\\mu^{ex}(c)\\) or a discrete-state boundary condition that we can compare to Donnan partitioning (both are \u201centry free energy\u201d in different languages).\n- From **iontronics**: a clear separation of \u201ccapacity-limited\u201d vs \u201ctransport-limited\u201d saturation in a benchmark-like geometry (e.g., show how \\(C^*\\) introduces a new limiting mechanism absent in passive membranes).\n\nThat\u2019s my Round 2 contribution."

In the unified \\(\\mu\\) framework, this corresponds to a **strong, structured \\(\\mu_i^{ex}(x,\\{n\\})\\)** that depends on occupancy \\(\\{n\\}\\), not just position.\n\n**Benchmark mapping:** For the benchmark nanopore, biology can contribute a \u201cminimal discrete filter\u201d embedded in a continuum access region\u2014i.e., **resistances/energy barriers in series**.\n\n---\n\n# 3) Selectivity: when does \\(\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx RT\\ln(P_K/P_{Na})\\) hold?\n\nThis is a key point the Critic flagged.\n\n### Established: permeability ratios from reversal potentials are robust observables\nUnder bi-ionic conditions, \\(E_\\text{rev}\\) gives \\(P_K/P_{Na}\\) via GHK-type relations (with caveats for multi-ion effects). This is experimentally standard.\n\n### The mapping to a free-energy difference is conditionally valid\n\\[\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\approx RT\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_K}{P_{Na}}\\right)\n\\]\nis most justified when:\n- selectivity is dominated by an **entry/partition barrier** (a single dominant barrier),\n- permeation is **not strongly multi-ion correlated**, or the correlation affects both ions similarly,\n- the system is near **linear response** (small driving forces) so permeability behaves like an equilibrium-like coefficient.\n\nIt becomes **less justified** when:\n- conduction is **multi-ion** and the rate-limiting step is a correlated transition state,\n- \\(P_i\\) is not a simple partition coefficient but a compound of partitioning \u00d7 mobility \u00d7 occupancy,\n- there is strong **voltage dependence** of selectivity (e.g., block, field-dependent barriers).\n\n### Quantitative anchor (still useful as an order-of-magnitude discriminator)\nIf \\(P_K/P_{Na}=10^3\\), then:\n\\[\n\\Delta\\Delta G \\sim RT\\ln(1000)\\approx 17\\ \\text{kJ/mol}\n\\]\nEven if not exact mechanistically, this remains a valuable \u201cdesign target\u201d magnitude: **a ~15\u201320 kJ/mol differential stabilization is enough for 1000:1 selectivity**.\n\n---\n\n# 4) Limiting/saturation: separate access vs in-pore limitation experimentally\n\n## A. Access resistance vs in-pore limitation (protocol + expected scaling)\n**Access limitation prediction:** if access dominates, conductance scales roughly with bulk conductivity \\(\\kappa\\) and pore radius \\(a\\):\n\\[\nR_\\text{access}\\approx \\frac{1}{4a\\kappa}\n\\Rightarrow g_\\text{access}\\propto \\kappa \\propto c \\quad (\\text{at low/moderate }c)\n\\]\nSo at low salt, \\(g\\) should increase ~linearly with concentration.\n\n**In-pore/occupancy limitation prediction:** if the filter dominates, you often see saturation:\n\\[\ng(c)\\ \\text{or}\\ i(c) \\approx i_\\text{max}\\frac{c}{K_m+c}\n\\]\nSo at high salt, \\(g\\) plateaus even though \\(\\kappa\\) continues to rise.\n\n**Experimental separation strategy (established approach):**\n1. Measure single-channel \\(i\\) vs \\(V\\) at multiple symmetric salt concentrations (e.g., 10, 50, 150, 500 mM KCl).\n2. Fit low-\\(c\\) regime to access scaling and high-\\(c\\) regime to saturation.\n3. Perturb vestibule charges (mutations) or add charged blockers:\n   - If vestibule mutation changes low-\\(c\\) conductance strongly but not high-\\(c\\), that implicates access/entry.\n   - If mutations in the selectivity filter change \\(K_m\\) and \\(i_\\text{max}\\), that implicates in-pore occupancy/barriers.\n\nThis is directly analogous to membrane/electrochemistry: **boundary layer vs membrane interior**.\n\n## B. Gating vs permeation saturation\nTo separate gating (open probability) from permeation:\n- Use **single-channel recordings** and analyze **open-state current amplitude** separately from **open probability \\(P_o\\)**.\n- Permeation saturation affects the **open-state current amplitude**; gating affects \\(P_o\\).\n\n---\n\n# 5) Falsifiable predictions for the benchmark problems\n\n## Benchmark A (voltage-driven charged pore/membrane)\n**Prediction B1 (series limitation):** total conductance behaves like resistances in series:\n\\[\nR_\\text{total} \\approx R_\\text{access} + R_\\text{pore}\n\\]\nSo changing bulk conductivity (salt concentration) should change \\(R_\\text{access}\\) but not \\(R_\\text{pore}\\) much; changing filter chemistry (fixed charge / binding sites) changes \\(R_\\text{pore}\\) strongly.\n\n**Prediction B2 (selectivity\u2013conductance tradeoff is not inevitable):**\nBiological K\\(^+\\) channels demonstrate that high selectivity and high flux can coexist via multi-ion knock-on. For synthetic benchmarks, if a model predicts an unavoidable selectivity\u2013conductance tradeoff, biology suggests that **multi-ion occupancy/correlation can break that tradeoff**. That\u2019s a falsifiable hypothesis: include multi-ion states and see if both can be high simultaneously.\n\n## Benchmark B (pressure-driven)\nBiology is less directly relevant (channels aren\u2019t pressure-driven filters in the RO sense), but the conceptual mapping is: pressure-driven convection corresponds to adding a \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) term; in narrow single-file pores, convection is not meaningful\u2014so I would explicitly state **continuum convection breaks down** at \u00c5-scale.\n\n---\n\n# 6) Polite disagreement / refinement to Round 2 framing\nI agree with the Chair\u2019s \u201ccore + closures\u201d plan. My refinement is:\n\n- For the benchmark, if we include a **sub-nm selective region**, we should not force it into a continuum closure with a smooth \\(\\mu^{ex}(x)\\) unless we explicitly acknowledge it\u2019s an effective representation of discrete coordination chemistry. Otherwise we risk comparing \u201capples (discrete binding)\u201d to \u201coranges (mean-field partitioning).\u201d\n\nA practical compromise: benchmark pore = **continuum access regions + a short discrete/selective segment** (a \u201cselectivity filter module\u201d). That lets membranes/electrochemistry use Donnan/PNP in access regions while biology contributes a mechanistic filter closure.\n\n---\n\n# 7) What I need from others (to make the benchmark cross-field)\n- From **membranes:** a representative fixed charge density \\(X\\) and pore size \\(r_p\\) that yields a known permselectivity \\(\\alpha\\), so we can compare to a \u201cfilter module\u201d selectivity.\n- From **electrochemistry:** a concrete thermodynamic factor \\(\\chi(c)\\) and \\(t_+^0\\) for one electrolyte, so we can see how much selectivity can be achieved without specific binding.\n- From **iontronics:** a clear definition of coupling selectivity \\(S_i\\) and whether it can be expressed as an effective \\(\\mu^{ex}\\) (ion insertion free energy) plus a capacity term.\n\nThat\u2019s my Round 2 input."

This is a design tradeoff unique to iontronics.\n\n## Benchmark B (pressure-driven)\nIf convection is introduced in the electrolyte (microfluidic OECT), then:\n- Increasing flow increases mass-transfer coefficient \\(k\\), reducing concentration polarization near the channel and stabilizing response at high currents.\nThis is analogous to membrane CP mitigation, but the observable is **electronic drift**.\n\n---\n\n# 6) Polite disagreement / refinement to the Chair\u2019s benchmark plan\nI support the two-regime pore size idea (electroneutral vs Poisson). My refinement is:\n\n- For iontronics, the key regime boundary is often **not** \\(r_p/\\lambda_D\\) but **whether the device is capacitive vs Faradaic**. Two devices with identical geometry can behave completely differently depending on electrode chemistry and bias window.\n\nSo I propose the benchmark explicitly includes a \u201creaction term toggle\u201d:\n- **Mode 1 (capacitive/volumetric storage):** \\(R\\) represents reversible insertion (modeled via \\(C^*\\)).\n- **Mode 2 (Faradaic):** \\(R\\) includes irreversible reactions (water splitting, redox degradation).\n\nThis will prevent us from mislabeling stability-limited behavior as \u201ctransport-limited.\u201d\n\n---\n\n# 7) What I need from others to close the loop\n- From **membranes:** a concrete Du-based criterion and a representative surface charge so we can compare \u201csurface conduction\u201d to \u201cpolymer volumetric conduction\u201d as two different bypass pathways beyond limiting current.\n- From **electrochemistry:** a representative \\(\\chi(c)\\) and \\(t_+^0\\) dataset so we can see how much of OECT behavior could be captured by concentrated-solution transport vs polymer-specific \\(\\mu^{ex}\\).\n- From **biology:** a minimal discrete filter model that can be embedded as a boundary condition for a continuum access region\u2014this is directly analogous to how we treat polymer redox sites as a volumetric storage term.\n\nThat\u2019s my Round 2 contribution."

State assumptions.\n\n**Answer (unified across fields):**  \nWith assumptions stated explicitly per regime, the governing flux law can be written as:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\mathbf{J}_i = -\\frac{D_i c_i}{RT}\\nabla\\mu_i + c_i\\mathbf{u}}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\mu_i=\\mu_i^0+RT\\ln a_i+z_iF\\phi+\\mu_i^{ex}}\n\\]\nwith mass conservation:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\partial_t c_i+\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{J}_i=R_i}\n\\]\n\n**Assumptions (must be declared; typical by field):**\n- **Electrochemistry (battery porous media):** electroneutral bulk; concentrated-solution thermodynamics (\\(a_\\pm=\\gamma_\\pm c\\), thermodynamic factor \\(\\chi\\)); no convection in separator; effective-medium \\(D_\\text{eff},\\kappa_\\text{eff}\\); interfacial Butler\u2013Volmer at electrodes.\n- **Membranes:** electroneutral membrane bulk with fixed charge \\(X\\); Donnan equilibrium at interfaces; hindered transport + convection in NF; solution\u2013diffusion in RO; Poisson/space charge needed near depletion/overlimiting or in very small pores.\n- **Biology:** either (i) continuum PNP/GHK (steady, mean-field, often constant field) with effective permeabilities, or (ii) discrete-state occupancy kinetics when \\(\\mu^{ex}\\) is large and structured.\n- **Iontronics:** Nernst\u2013Planck + continuity with a coupling term \\(R_i\\) representing reversible insertion/volumetric storage (via \\(C^*\\)) or irreversible Faradaic reactions outside stability window; quasi-electroneutral polymer bulk often assumed.\n\n**Justification:**  \nAll teams independently converged on electrochemical potential gradients as the universal driving force; differences are in closures for \\(a_i\\), \\(\\mu^{ex}\\), \\(\\phi\\), \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), and \\(R_i\\), which we will now standardize and benchmark.\n\n---\n\n#### Agenda Question 2  \n**Question:** What physical property determines ion selectivity in your system, and how is it measured?\n\n**Answer (taxonomy-based, because \u201cselectivity\u201d is not a single object):**\n\n1) **Partition (equilibrium) selectivity** is determined by differences in **electrochemical potential of transfer** into the membrane/pore/polymer (Donnan electrostatics + sterics + solvation/dehydration; i.e., \\(\\Delta \\mu^{ex}\\) and fixed charge).  \n- **Measured by:** sorption/uptake (membranes/iontronics), Donnan/membrane potentials, rejection \\(R=1-c_p/c_f\\) (RO/NF), or inferred partition coefficients.\n\n2) **Transport selectivity under driving** is determined by relative mobilities and coupling\u2014captured by **transference/transport numbers** \\(t_i\\), permselectivity \\(\\alpha\\), or permeability ratios \\(P_i/P_j\\) under specified conditions.  \n- **Measured by:** eNMR/Hittorf/polarization for \\(t_+\\) (electrochemistry), membrane potential for \\(\\alpha\\) (IEMs), reversal potentials for \\(P_i/P_j\\) (biology).\n\n3) **(Iontronics-specific) Coupling selectivity** is determined by how strongly a given ion\u2019s insertion changes electronic carrier density/morphology\u2014captured by:\n\\[\nS_i=\\partial \\sigma_e/\\partial Q_i \\quad \\text{or}\\quad \\partial I_D/\\partial Q_i\n\\]\n- **Measured by:** integrating gate charge \\(Q=\\int I_G dt\\) with validation (EQCM/optical/EIS) to exclude Faradaic artifacts.\n\n**Quantitative examples (from discussion):**\n- **Membrane Donnan exclusion:** \\(X=1\\) M, \\(c_b=0.1\\) M \u2192 \\(c_-^m\\approx 0.01\\) M (\u224810\u00d7 co-ion exclusion, ideal Donnan).\n- **Biology:** \\(P_K/P_{Na}\\sim 10^3\\Rightarrow \\Delta\\Delta G\\sim 17\\) kJ/mol (useful scale; mapping conditional).\n- **Electrochemistry:** \\(t_+^0\\sim 0.2\u20130.4\\) in common carbonate electrolytes (method/frame dependent).\n- **Iontronics:** \\(C^*\\sim 10\u201340\\) F/cm\u00b3; small device can move \\(Q\\sim 10^{-9}\\) C (~\\(6\\times 10^9\\) ions) per switch at 0.5 V.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe meeting showed selectivity is multi-definition across fields; the taxonomy prevents category errors (e.g., equating rejection with transference number) and enables direct comparison via the benchmark.\n\n---\n\n#### Agenda Question 3  \n**Question:** What causes the \u201climiting\u201d or saturation behavior in ion transport for your systems?\n\n**Answer (organized by universal archetypes + field-specific additions):**\n\n**Universal limiting archetypes (shared physics):**\n1) **Boundary-layer / access limitation (diffusion supply):** depletion in a diffusion layer of thickness \\(\\delta\\) or access resistance to a pore mouth.  \n   - Canonical scaling:\n     \\[\n     i_\\text{lim}\\approx zF\\frac{Dc_b}{\\delta}\n     \\]\n   - Numbers:\n     - Electrochemistry example: \\(D=10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\\), \\(c_b=1\\) M, \\(\\delta=100\\,\\mu\\)m \u2192 \\(i_\\text{lim}\\sim 9.6\\,\\mathrm{mA/cm^2}\\).\n     - ED example: \\(D=10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\\), \\(c_b=0.01\\) M, \\(\\delta=100\\,\\mu\\)m \u2192 \\(i_\\text{lim}\\sim 0.96\\,\\mathrm{mA/cm^2}\\).\n     - Biology access resistance: \\(R_\\text{access}\\approx 1/(4a\\kappa)\\) gives an upper-bound current scale.\n\n2) **In-medium / in-pore limitation:** finite mobility/hindrance/occupancy inside the membrane/pore/polymer.  \n   - Biology: occupancy-limited saturation \\(i(c)=i_\\text{max}c/(K_m+c)\\).  \n   - NF: hindered diffusion and electromigration in nm pores.  \n   - Iontronics: diffusion into polymer \\(\\tau\\sim L^2/D_\\text{ion}\\) (e.g., 100 nm, \\(10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\\) \u2192 1 ms).\n\n3) **Interfacial kinetics / reactions:** Butler\u2013Volmer at electrodes; water splitting at IEM surfaces; Faradaic side reactions in iontronics beyond stability window.\n\n**Field-specific saturation mechanisms:**\n- **Iontronics:** **capacity-limited** saturation due to finite volumetric charge storage \\(Q_\\text{max}\\approx C^*V(\\text{volume})V_G\\), and **stability-limited** saturation due to electrochemical window.\n- **Biology:** **gating** and **block** can saturate macroscopic current independent of permeation limits.\n- **Membranes:** **overlimiting** currents via electroconvection/surface conduction/water splitting; discriminated by Du and operating regime \\(i/i_\\text{lim}\\).\n- **Electrochemistry:** \u201csoft limiting\u201d via conductivity collapse \\(\\kappa(c)\\) and strong concentration dependence of transport coefficients.\n\n**Justification:**  \nAll fields can be mapped onto a small set of limiting archetypes; differences are which element dominates and whether additional state variables (occupancy, doping state, reactions) introduce new ceilings.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1) **Freeze Benchmark A1 and B1 specifications (write them down as a one-page protocol):**\n   - A1: binary 1:1 electrolyte; \\(c_b=\\{10,100\\}\\) mM; \\(\\delta\\) fixed (e.g., 100 \u00b5m); imposed current sweep; interface selectivity specified by \\(t_+^m\\) or ideal permselective BC; outputs required.\n   - B1: specify \\(k\\), \\(A\\), \\(P_s\\) (or equivalent) and compute CP/rejection/flux relations.\n\n2) **Collect \u201cparameter provenance\u201d for each field (one line each):**\n   - Electrochemistry: provide one dataset for \\(t_+^0(c)\\) and \\(\\chi(c)\\) for a named electrolyte and method.\n   - Membranes: provide \\(X\\), \\(\\alpha\\) vs concentration range, and when \\(\\alpha\\approx 2t_+^m-1\\) holds.\n   - Biology: pick one named channel dataset with \\(g\\), \\(P_K/P_{Na}\\), conditions.\n   - Iontronics: provide \\(C^*\\) and \\(D_\\text{ion}\\) with extraction method and a criterion for \u201creversible capacitive regime.\u201d\n\n3) **Prepare standardized reporting tables (one per field) for the next meeting.**  \n   Include closures, selectivity metrics (partition + transport + optional coupling), limiting criterion + number, and one falsifiable scaling prediction.\n\n4) **Decide on Benchmark A2 (nanopore) only after A1 is completed.**  \n   This prevents underdetermined modeling debates and ensures we first validate cross-field alignment on the simplest falsifiable case.\n\n5) **Create a shared \u201cdictionary\u201d document (living):**\n   - Map: Donnan potential \u2194 partitioning term in \\(\\mu^{ex}\\); permselectivity \\(\\alpha\\) \u2194 \\(t_+^m\\); access resistance \u2194 diffusion boundary layer; volumetric capacitance \\(C^*\\) \u2194 storage term \\(R_i\\)/state variable.\n   - For each analogy, explicitly list where it holds and where it breaks (e.g., convection meaningless in single-file \u00c5 pores; electroneutrality fails near depletion/overlimiting).\n\nThis closes Round 1/2 with a concrete path to a unified, testable framework rather than a purely conceptual synthesis."
